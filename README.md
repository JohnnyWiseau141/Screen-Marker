### Moving Forward

- Implement an API so users can search for movies to add to their collection
- Add Boolean Fields to the Show model in order to check whether a series is still ongoing, and to check if the user has completed watching
- Change runtime and timestop in the Show model from CharFields to Timefields so users can easily input where they left off
